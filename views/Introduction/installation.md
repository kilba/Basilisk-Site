# Introduction
## Welcome to Basilisk
Basilisk aims to be a rendering engine written only in OpenGL without the help of any external libraries. This means that components such as 3D model loading/parsing/rendering, True Type Font loading/parsing/rendering, etc... will be written from scratch.

## Who is it for
The engine is targeted at anyone who finds limitations with game development frameworks such as Monogame or Raylib. The engine can also be used for developing user interfaces, though most would
rather develop in libraries that are more user friendly and with better cross platform compatibility, such as React. Though if you require speed with ease of access to GPU acceleration, Basilisk is 
probably a better option.
